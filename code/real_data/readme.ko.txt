The data used in this article are based on the dataset used by 

  Justin Wolfers, "Did Unilateral Divorce Raise Divorce Rates? 
  A Reconciliation and New Results", American Economic Review, 
  96(5), December 2006, 1802-1820.

To create the balanced panel data, we conduct interpolation as 
discribed in the Appendix. All data are in the file ko-data.txt, an
ASCII (text) file in DOS format. It is zipped in the file ko-data.zip.
Unix/Linux users should use "unzip -a".

The file ko-data.txt contains the following variables;

Column  1: State (two-letter abbreviation)
Column  2: Year  (1956-1998)
Column  3: Divorces per 1000 people
Column  4: logarithm of Divorce per 1000 people
Column  5: Divorce law reform dummy (First 2 years)
Column  6: Divorce law reform dummy (3 - 4  years)
Column  7: Divorce law reform dummy (5 - 6  years)
Column  8: Divorce law reform dummy (7 - 8  years)
Column  9: Divorce law reform dummy (9 - 10 years)
Column 10: Divorce law reform dummy (11- 12 years)
